[desc] Used mostly in harbour and river engineering. Used in inland waters. It is generally defined as a level which the daily mean water level would fall below less than 5 percent of the time and by no more than 0.2 metres during the navigation season. A single level surface is usually chosen as the low water datum for a whole lake. On a river, low water datum is a sloping surface, which approximates the surface of the river at a low state.</td></tr><tr><td>lowWaterSprings</td><td>Low Water Springs: A level approximating that of mean low water springs.</td></tr><tr><td>meanHigherHighWater</td><td>Mean Higher High Water: The average height of higher high waters at a location over a 19-year period.</td></tr><tr><td>meanHigherHighWaterSprings</td><td>Mean Higher High Water Springs: The average height of higher high water at spring tides at a location.</td></tr><tr><td>meanHighWater</td><td>Mean High Water: The average height of all high waters at a location over a 19-year period.</td></tr><tr><td>meanHighWaterNeaps</td><td>Mean High Water Neaps: The average height of the high waters of the neap tide.</td></tr><tr><td>meanHighWaterSprings</td><td>Mean High Water Springs: The average height of the high waters of spring tides.</td></tr><tr><td>meanLowerLowWater</td><td>Mean Lower Low Water: The average height of the lower low waters at a location over a 19-year period.</td></tr><tr><td>meanLowerLowWaterSprings</td><td>Mean Lower Low Water Springs: The average height of lower low water at spring tides at a location.</td></tr><tr><td>meanLowWater</td><td>Mean Low Water: The average height of all low waters at a location over a 19-year period.</td></tr><tr><td>meanLowWaterNeaps</td><td>Mean Low Water Neaps: The average height of the low waters of the neap tide.</td></tr><tr><td>meanLowWaterSprings</td><td>Mean Low Water Springs: The average height of the low waters of spring tides.</td></tr><tr><td>meanSeaLevel</td><td>Mean Sea Level (MSL): A continuous surface over the oceans (or its hypothetical extension under the land masses) defined by the mean of sea level surfaces approximated and observed over 19 years.</td></tr><tr><td>meanTideLevel</td><td>Mean Tide Level: The arithmetic mean of mean high water and mean low water.</td></tr><tr><td>meanWaterLevel</td><td>Mean Water Level: The average of all hourly water levels over the available period of record.</td></tr><tr><td>navd88</td><td>North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988: A fixed reference for elevations derived from a general adjustment of the first-order terrestrial levelling nets of the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

[desc] The neap range of the tide is the average range occurring at the time of neap tides and is most conveniently computed from the harmonic constants. It is smaller than the mean range where the type of tide is either semi-diurnal or mixed and is of no practical significance where the type of tide is predominantly diurnal.</td></tr><tr><td>nearlyHighestHighWater</td><td>Nearly Highest High Water: An arbitrary level approximating the highest water level observed at a location, usually equivalent to the high water springs.</td></tr><tr><td>nearlyLowestLowWater</td><td>Nearly Lowest Low Water: A level approximating the lowest water level observed at a location, usually equivalent to Indian spring low water.</td></tr><tr><td>ngvd29</td><td>National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1929: A fixed reference for elevations derived from a general adjustment in 1929 of the first-order leveling nets of both the United States and Canada.

[desc] The spring range of tide is the average range occurring at the time of spring tides and is most conveniently computed from the harmonic constants. It is larger than the mean range where the type of tide is either semi-diurnal or mixed, and is of no practical significance where the type of tide is predominantly diurnal.</td></tr><tr><td>waterLevel</td><td>Water Level: A locally observed level of the water surface. [desc] In the case of non-tidal waters (for example: lakes or rivers) it is necessary to specify hydrologic conditions in order to ensure a precise reference surface specification.
