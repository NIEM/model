If this attribute is omitted, the data have not been compressed. The kinds of data compression are as follows: - None: the data are not compressed. The number of values in the Channel Data element is equal to the number of channels of data represented by the element. - Counted Zeroes: the data have been compressed by the removal of repeated zero values. When a "0" value appears in the Channel Data contents, the next value is the number of consecutive zero-value channels beginning with the first zero-value in the sequence. For example, the following 18 channels of uncompressed data: 22 5 0 2 1 0 0 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 would be represented in compressed form by 22 5 0 1 2 1 0 2 3 4 0 8 1 The italicized values in the list show cases where one, two, and eight zeroes have been compressed.</p><h2>Diagram</h2><a name="diagram"><div style="text-align: center;"><object type="image/svg+xml" data="diagram.svg"></object></div></a><h2>XML Schema</h2><a name="xml-schema"><div class="xml-schema"><div class="block"><div class="line">&lt;xs:attribute name="compressionCode" type="<a href="../../cbrncl/CompressionCodeSimpleType/#xml-schema">cbrncl:CompressionCodeSimpleType</a>"&gt;</div><div class="block"><div class="line">&lt;xs:annotation&gt;</div><div class="block"><div class="line">&lt;xs:documentation&gt;</div>An algorithm, if any, by which the channel data have been compressed.
